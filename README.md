# OpenSCAD based 3D printable graver sharpening jig.

This is a customizable version of the excellent sharpening jig by Jack Hobson https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4599936

Main problem with Jack's jig is that it has been created with Fusion360, which I do not have and do not want to install. So I made a new base plate with OpenSCAD to easily change the parameters. You will still need the holders from Jack's version. 

There are some sanity checks in place, but please change the parameters within reason. 

| Variable Name  | Meaning      | Interval  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|

| beta   | Cutting angle of the graver  | 30°-180° |
| theta | Heel angle of the graver | 2°-20° |
| s_elevation | The distance between the gliding plane and the grinding surface | 0-100 |
| s_stickout | THe distance the graver sticks out from the face plane | 0-100 |
